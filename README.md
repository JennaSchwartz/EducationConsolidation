# Education Consolidation

Due to Covid-19, schools and educators had to quickly shift to remote classrooms. Especially for elementary schools, this brings a set of challenges. Teachers are using a variety of different tools and platforms to teach and distribute assignments. It can be time-consuming for teachers to check in and pull grades from each of these platforms.

Because elementary school students are so young, teachers often have to involve parents or guardians to hold students accountable. Contacting the parents of students multiple times a week can become frustrating and even more time-consuming. 

Thus, we are building a prototype of a tool that will present a consolidated view of assignments and provide a simplified way to alert parents about upcoming or unfinished assignments. 

These are some of the painpoints we hope this tool helps solve:

- Teachers are frustrated because there is no consolidated way to alert parents about upcoming assignments or unfinished assignments. Teachers spend even more time and effort when parents speak different languages apart from English translating the messages about their students' work.

- There is no way to keep a student in elementary school accountable to get their work done.  

- Teachers spend a lot of time giving assignments and inputting/retrieving grades that are spread out over multiple platforms.
